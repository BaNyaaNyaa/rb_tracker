This a tracker package for Poptracker. It features auto-tracking with Archipelago.

## Installation

Just download the lastest release and put it in your packs folder.

## Explanations

### Event Tracking
This tracker features manual event tracking if you use base-0.6.3-AP or automatic event tracking if you use the apworld [from this post](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1385260958192242689/1423751528900067368) or source-AP. Please use the appropriate variant.

### Encounter & Pokédex Related
The tracker can currently not track which Pokémon you have obtained or where which Pokémon is. It will show you what Pokémon are Dexsanity Checks and which dexsanity checks have been sent out already.

The Encounter Tab only features manual tracking.

## ROADMAP
With support from Alchav and GerbilJames I will bring this Tracker more up to par with the Crystal, FRLG and Emerald one. Features soon to be added include:
- Dexsanity Support
- Full Encounter Tracking

## Credits
