This a tracker package for Poptracker. It features auto-tracking with Archipelago.

## Installation

Just download the lastest release and put it in your packs folder.

## Option Explanations

You need to track whether you free'd Fuji and whether you liberated Silph Co. manually by clicking their icon either at their respective locations or in your Item List.

All of the below is basically unimportant if you're simply auto-tracking. For sake of manual tracking and a deeper explanation, all options will be explained.
### Items
- Right-Click on any HM to indicate what Badge unlocks its functionality in Extra-HM-Mode
- Tea: Only visible when Tea is in the pool
- Card Key: Controlled by the Card Key Setting
- Extra Key Items: Only visible when Extra Key Item Option is on.
  
### Pokédex-related
